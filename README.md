# ASCII Portrait Generator

This project is a simple ASCII portrait generator that converts input images into ASCII art. It utilizes TypeScript for type safety and modularity.

## Features

- Converts images to ASCII art based on pixel brightness.
- Modular design with separate files for image processing and ASCII mapping.
- Easy to use with a simple command-line interface.
